TASK 1
Input: The code first prompts the user to enter two numbers.  
input() function is used to get the input from the user, and int() function converts the input string to an integer. 
These integers are stored in the variables first_number and second_number.

Calculations:  The code then performs the following arithmetic operations:

Addition: Collection = first_number + second_number calculates the sum of the two numbers.
Subtraction: Extraction = first_number - second_number calculates the difference between the two numbers.
Multiplication: Multiplication = first_number * second_number calculates the product of the two numbers.
Division: Division = first_number / second_number calculates the quotient of the two numbers (floating-point division).
Floor Division (Full Division): Full_division = first_number // second_number calculates the integer quotient (discards the remainder).
Modulo (Mode Retrieval): Mode_retrieval = first_number % second_number calculates the remainder of the division.
Exponentiation (Base Taking): Base_taking = first_number ** second_number calculates first_number raised to the power of second_number.


TASK 2
Input: The code prompts the user to enter the radius of the circle using the input() function. The entered value (which is initially a string) is then converted to an integer using the int() function and stored in the variable take_radius.

Calculation: The code calculates the area of the circle using the formula:  Area = π * r^2, where π (pi) is approximated as 3.14 and r is the radius.  The radius is squared using the exponentiation operator ** 2. The result of the calculation is stored in the variable area_circle.

Output: Finally, the code prints the calculated area of the circle to the console using the print() function.
