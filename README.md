Input: The code first prompts the user to enter two numbers.  
input() function is used to get the input from the user, and int() function converts the input string to an integer. 
These integers are stored in the variables first_number and second_number.

Calculations:  The code then performs the following arithmetic operations:

Addition: Collection = first_number + second_number calculates the sum of the two numbers.
Subtraction: Extraction = first_number - second_number calculates the difference between the two numbers.
Multiplication: Multiplication = first_number * second_number calculates the product of the two numbers.
Division: Division = first_number / second_number calculates the quotient of the two numbers (floating-point division).
Floor Division (Full Division): Full_division = first_number // second_number calculates the integer quotient (discards the remainder).
Modulo (Mode Retrieval): Mode_retrieval = first_number % second_number calculates the remainder of the division.
Exponentiation (Base Taking): Base_taking = first_number ** second_number calculates first_number raised to the power of second_number.
